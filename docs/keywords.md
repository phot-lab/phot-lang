### FUNC

The keyword 'func' is used to define a functor.
The concept of 'functor' is similar to C++ Functor,
which has few relationship with Haskell Functor.
You can simply think of it as a function with its own entity(or data),
or an entity with its own functional behavior.
In PSL, a functor can be treated as an entity,
so it can be passed as a parameter to other functors.
